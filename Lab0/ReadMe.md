   * ### Download glfw libray from https://www.glfw.org/download.html. Download *64-bit Windows binaries* from *Windows pre-compiled binaries*. ###  
   * ### Create **build** and **lib** folder in Code Repo. Put *glfw3.dll* from *lib-mingw-w64* folder of glfw library to **build** and **lib** folder.  ###
   * ### For C++ compiler and make, Download MSYS2 Package Manager from https://www.msys2.org/ . ###  
   * ### Run following commands in MSYS2 terminal: ```pacman -S base-devel``` and ```pacman -S gcc``` . ### 
   * ### add your bin folder (which includes g++.exe and make.exe) PATH (C:\msys64\usr\bin) of msys64 installation directory in your environment variable.
   * ### Run ```make win``` in Terminal. ###
   * ### ```.exe``` file will be in **build** folder. ###
   * ### if your code does not run, then you have to check openGL version by installing GLview from http://www.realtech-vr.com/home/glview . If your openGL version is below 3.3, then update windows. ###
